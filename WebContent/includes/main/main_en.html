				A <strong class="hiroshajo-text-mark">The Híröshajó</strong>, (Private) Limited Company deals with the design and production of
				catamaran bottomed fibreglass plastic ships, boats and fishing boats.
			</p>
			<p class="text-justify">Our products: ships, boats and fishboats are sold under different fancy names such as <strong>K mini boat&box, K
				maxxi, K maxxi extra, K maxxi joker, K1 fisherman, K maxxi delfin, K maxxi cabrio, K2 party, K maxi party, valamint K maxxi delfin II.</strong></p>

			<p class="text-justify">Beginning with designing throughout production finishing with the final quality control we bear in mind the
				following criteria. Every hull - whether it's a ship supplied with an impressive engine, or a fishing boat equipped with bench seats for
				several people or a tiny boat for one or two persons; has to meet all the security requirements at the highest level. Its construction
				should make it suitable for enjoying any kind of activity as they all have to satisfy different requirements when used for sports, or
				rawing or even several day fishing tours. Different criteria must be met either in the case of a tourist craft, a pleasure craft or a
				fishing bout used for an overnight tour.</p>
			<p class="text-justify">Other important criteria is that materials and technologies used in the course of manufacture should result
				in long-lifetime and sturdy structure which properly used and with minimal maintenance - that is regular cleaning - will definitely
				serve its owner for a long time.</p>
			<p class="text-justify">If you are looking for a ship, a boat, or perhaps a fishing boat giving value for money, and at a reasonable
				price or are just interested in our products, you can find a lot of photos and answers to all your questions on the following pages. But
				of course, I am at your service either personally or on the phone.</p>
