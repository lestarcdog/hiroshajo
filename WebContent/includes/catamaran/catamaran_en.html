		<p class="lead hiroshajo-color">Which one should I choose?</p>
		<p class="text-justify">I try to summarise in some sentences what kind of questions raise mostly while choosing the type of a boat. The first one:
			with or without licence? You can drive any boat without little ship licence up to 10 HP/PS motor capacity. With 5 HP/PS
			you can reach 10 km/h speed which is suitable e.g. for River Tisza, Tisza Lake and the Adriatic.</p>
		<p>For travelling e.g. on the Danube - because of its stronger current - you have to choose a stronger engine. Above 25 HP/PS
			you have to build a motor fixing element in the boat, to which you have to truss the upper fastening screws of your engine.
			Above 25 HP/PS you will have to choose long boots engine and a boat with extra strenghtening. in addition you will need
			a wheel and a remote control. From 2014 all the standard boats get an extra crackproof layer which is perfectly fine up
			to 25 HP/PS engines. Above 25 HP/PS engines it is necessary to strenghten with an extra layer the sliding surface in order
			to prevent the resonance effect and the damages to the boat.</p>

		<p class="lead hiroshajo-color">Why a catamaran?</p>
		<p class="text-justify">
			If you don't like when the boat rocks under your feet, if the family has seasickness on every boat trip, if you angle by
			oneself and you would like to pull out the 90 kg catfish or if you just want a good course performance and maximum stability,
			then choose a CATAMARAN. H&iacute;r&ouml;shaj&oacute; Ltd in Kecskem&eacute;t
			<br /> has been going in for designing and building of plastic boats since 1995. While designing the hulls our most important
			aim is to reach great standing sidelong stability, good taxiing feature and security in spite of the little sizes. For
			these purposes the catamaran form of bottom seemed to be the best solution.
			<br /> This has made it a popular type among anglers. The boats are hand-made in little series from fibreglass plasticsuitable
			only for shipbuilding. Further great advantage is that the individual types can supplement with a module system and they
			are variable at special requests. Self-built wheels, sitting
			<br /> boxes, rotatable and fixed seats etc. are available for every type.
